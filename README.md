1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of counties where votes were cast.
3. Calculate the total number of votes cast in each county.
4. Calculate the total percentage of votes cast in each county.
5. Determine the county with the largest voter turnout.
6. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
7. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
8. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
9. Determine the winner of the election based on popular votes.

## Election-Audit Summary
The code is written to evaluate any election. By using lists and loops, the code pulls information directly from the CSV data. The use of lists creates flexibility that allows for a large number of candidates. The loops assure each row in the CSV data will be counted:

If a future CSV included a 4th column with party affiliation, the code could be updated to include that data by integrating a list to hold the party affiliation. The party affiliation written to the list variable at this point in the code:

![party affiliation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24308495/136894622-6170f344-e153-484c-92e8-4fc54f788956.PNG)

The affiliation could be included in the candidate_votes dictionary variable, along with the candidate name, so that it could be referenced in the text document.

The code rounds percentages off to the tenths place. This was not an issue in this specific election because the race was not particularly close. However, if this code was used to audit a close election, such as the state of Florida in the 2000 presidential election, it would need to provide a more precise number in order to be meaningful. To do this, we would update this line of code:

![more_precise_decimal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24308495/136896133-a7fea85f-39e8-4aec-ad9a-9c6f8c8518be.PNG)

We would change the number in {vote_percentage:.1f} to indicate how places after the decimal we want to print. For example, if we wanted to print the number to thousandths decimal place, we would enter {vote_percentage:.3f}.
